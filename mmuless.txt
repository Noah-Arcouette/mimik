fork -> Send fork to message channels, Remap all other pages, Redo the relocations

Everything with fork must be PIE, lots and lots of PIE

mmap:
	Virt Phys | Outcome
	----------+---------
	NULL NULL | get unused physical memory and return it as the virtual address
	NULL Phys | return physical address, if possible, allowing for shared memory
	Virt NULL | return physical address, if possible, NOT allowing for shared memory
	Virt Phys | Same as NULL:Phys, but check that Virt = Phys
